### Tests:  
How do you run tests?  
I conducted tests via pass/fail using if statements and an infinite while loop.  

Any tests of note?  
My best tests were done with my infinite `while` loop with an `if` statement to break the loop upon a certain input (`"quit"`).  

Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc  
I decided to quit testing for matching inputs to the example already provided due to lack of knowledge for syntax and lack of time.
